  NgxQueryParamFormSyncComponent\nThe NgxQueryParamFormSyncComponent allows you to sync queryParams with a form provided in the component.\nAn ideal use-case for this component is filtered views that keep the selected filters in queryParams. This abstraction ensures that both the visual filters and the url stay in sync. This way the url can be shared, and the view will be filtered as shared.\nMethods\nWhen implementing the NgxQueryParamFormSyncComponent, there is only one method that requires implementation, being the initForm method. This method should return a form that will be used to store the queryParams in the component.\nThe component also provides a clearData method that will automatically clear the form.\nOptional methods\nOptionally, you want to interact with the changes in the form, like dispatching the data to a store. By implementing the optional handleDataChanges method, you can listen to these changes and handle them accordingly. It is very important to not subscribe to an Observable in this method, as it within itself is already used within a subscription.\nSometimes, certain data cannot be put in the queryParams without being scrambled first. This can be useful in situations in which some of the items in the queryParams are protected by GDPR, but you still wish to be able to share the url to a filtered view. In order to handle these situations, we provide the optional methods scrambleParams and the unscrambleParams, in which you can provide an implementation to scramble these items before sending them to the url.\nExample\nExample :import { scrambler, unscrambler } from 'ngx-random-package';\n\ninterface Filters {\n    searchQuery: string;\n    sorting: string;\n}\n\ninterface FiltersForm {\n    searchQuery: FormControl;\n    sorting: FormControl;\n}\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'table-view',\n    templateUrl: './survey.component.html',\n})\nexport class TableViewComponent extends NgxQueryParamFormSyncComponent\n> {\n    constructor(\n        readonly route: ActivatedRoute,\n        readonly router: Router,\n        readonly storeService: NgxStoreService\n    ) {\n        super(route, router);\n    }\n\n    initForm(): FormGroup {\n        return new FormGroup({\n            searchQuery: new FormControl(),\n            sorting: new FormControl(),\n        });\n    }\n\n    handleDataChanges(value: Filters) {\n        this.storeService.setFilters(value);\n    }\n\n    scrambleParams(value: Filters) {\n        return {\n            ...value,\n            sorting: scrambler(value.sorting),\n        };\n    }\n\n    unscrambleParams(value: Filters) {\n        return {\n            ...value,\n            sorting: unscrambler(value.sorting),\n        };\n    }\n}\n    \n\n    \n        import { Directive, OnDestroy, OnInit, inject } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AbstractControl } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { ActivatedRoute, Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport { Observable, Subject, filter, take, takeUntil, tap } from 'rxjs';\n\nexport type StringifiedQueryParamsType = {\n\t[key in keyof QueryParamsType]: string;\n};\n\n@Directive()\nexport abstract class NgxQueryParamFormSyncComponent\n\timplements OnInit, OnDestroy\n{\n\tprotected readonly route = inject(ActivatedRoute);\n\tprotected readonly router = inject(Router);\n\n\tprotected readonly destroyed$: Subject = new Subject();\n\n\t/**\n\t * The form in which we will save the queryParam data\n\t */\n\tpublic form: FormType;\n\n\t/**\n\t * The query params we wish to form\n\t */\n\tprotected queryParams$: Observable> = this.route\n\t\t.queryParams as Observable>;\n\n\tpublic ngOnInit(): void {\n\t\t//Iben: Warn the user if one of the two methods isn't provided\n\t\tif (\n\t\t\t(!this.scrambleParams && this.unscrambleParams) ||\n\t\t\t(this.scrambleParams && !this.unscrambleParams)\n\t\t) {\n\t\t\tconsole.error(\n\t\t\t\t`NgxUtils: NgxQueryParamFormSyncComponent detected the use of the parameter scrambling but is missing an implementation for the ${\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.scrambleParams ?

advantage of Angular web components.\nThis can be useful in combination with translation strings that require in-app links or WYSIWYG content from an external source.\nHow to use\nSet up\nThe pipe requires a couple of things to be provided before it can be used.\nFirst, create a component that will be used to replace your target:\nExample :@Component({\n    selector: 'link',\n    template: '',\n})\nexport class LinkComponent {\n    // Keep in mind that Angular's innerHTML & outerHTML will convert attributes to lower casing.\n    // This input property will need to be lowercased to make this work.\n    public link: InputSignal: input();\n}Then register it as a web component in your app.component.ts:\nExample :@Component({\n    //...\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n    constructor(\n        // ...\n        private readonly windowService: NgxWindowService,\n        private readonly injector: Injector\n    ) {\n        // Note that we are using our NgxWindowService (ngx-core) to avoid SSR issues.\n        if (this.windowService.isBrowser) {\n            const linkComponent = createCustomElement(LinkComponent, { injector: this.injector });\n\n            customElements.define('ngx-link', linkComponent);\n        }\n    }\n}Lastly set up the global config in your root provider array:\nExample :providers: [\n    //...\n    provideNgxReplaceElementsConfiguration({\n        link: {\n            element: 'ngx-link',\n            selector: 'a[data-link-id={{id}}]',\n            includeInnerHtml: true,\n        },\n        image: {\n            element: 'ngx-image',\n            selector: 'img[data-link-id={{id}}]',\n        },\n    }),\n];For each element we want to register, we define the WebComponent name using the element property. In order to be able to select an item to replace later on in the text, we create a selector. This selector should always include a part to identify the id, being {{id}}.\nIf we wish to use the original innerText of the element whilst replacing, we can do so by setting includeInnerHtml to true.\nUsing the pipe\nWhen the web component is set up, you can start using the pipe.\nFirst set up anchors in your input string:\nExample :\"This is a text with a link.\"The someUniqueId will be used by the pipe to find and replace your link element so make sure that each anchor within your translation has a unique identifier.\nWithin the template you can now provide the string and transform it like this:\nExample :Whilst id refers to the id in the string, elementId refers to the element we have configured in the configuration.\nThe data property can be used to set the inputs of our provided WebComponent. We once again want to stress that due to the nature of WebComponents, these properties can only have lowercase keys.\n\n    \n\n    \n        import { Pipe, PipeTransform, inject } from

 NgxStorageService\nThe NgxStorageService provides a SSR proof Observable approach to both session- and localStorage. It allows for listing to change events on specific properties or on the entire storage.\nApproach\nIn order to provide an Observable based approach to both the session- and localStorage, the session provides a localStorage and a sessionStorage object that offer custom methods that will also emit to the corresponding Observables. Data that was set to the session- or localStorage on the window directly will not be represented in the Observable.\nOn top of an Observable based approach, the new localStorage and sessionStorage implementations will automatically parse the data to a string when saving it to the window session- or localStorage, and will return the parsed value back when calling either getItem or getItemObservable.\nThe service is also SSR proof, and will prevent any actions from occurring when not in the browser.\nProperties\nlocalStorage/sessionStorage\nThe localStorage and sessionStorage objects of the NgxStorageService provide an Observable based approach to storage.\nIf we want to get an item from the storage, we can either use getItem or getItemObservable if we want the real time value vs an Observable respectively.\nUsing setItem and removeItem will set and remove an item in/from the storage respectively, and will emit an event on the storageEvents$ Observable.\nWhen using clear, the entire storage will be cleared, the Observables that were fetched using getItemObservable will be completed and an event will be emitted on the storageEvents$ observable.\nExample :import { NgxStorageService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-utils';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    constructor(private storageService: NgxStorageService) {\n        storageService.localStorage.setItem('Hello', { world: true });\n        storageService.sessionStorage.setItem('Hello', { world: true });\n    }\n}storageEvents$\nThe storageEvents$ property is an Observable that will emit a NgxStorageEvent whenever the session- or localStorage was updated (set or remove) or cleared.\nExample :import { NgxStorageService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-utils';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    constructor(private storageService: NgxStorageService) {\n        storageService.storageEvent$.subscribe(console.log);\n        // logs: {type: 'update', oldValue: undefined, newValue: {world: true}, key: 'Hello', storage: 'local'}\n        storageService.localStorage.setItem('Hello', { world: true });\n    }\n}\n    \n\n    \n

Allow the highlighted element to have additional whitespace around the cutout on the y-axis.\nThis is useful when the highlighted element is under a header or a footer.\nEven though it is possible to provide both a top and bottom offset, only one will be taken into\naccount. If the vertical center of the cutout is closer to the top, the top offset will be used. If\nthe vertical center of the cutout is closer to the bottom, the bottom offset will be used.\nNegative values are allowed. The step(card) will always be displayed within the viewport, even if\nthe offset makes the cutout go out of the viewport.\nThis is not the same as the cutoutMargin, which is the whitespace within the highlighted element.\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n

window and related information.\nIt is convenient for using the document or window without breaking SSR.\nProperties\nwidth$\nThe window-service exposes a width$ observable to get the window-width. It defaults to 1200 when no window is defined.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    public windowWidth$: Observable;\n\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {\n        this.windowWidth$ = this.windowService.width$;\n    }\n}scrollingUp$\nThe window-service exposes a scrollingUp$ observable to know when the scroll has ended.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    public scrollingUp$: Observable;\n\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {\n        this.scrollingUp$ = this.windowService.scrollingUp$;\n    }\n}currentScrollPosition\nThe window-service exposes a currentScrollPosition property that contains the currentScrollPosition after handleContentScroll has been called.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    public currentScrollPosition: Observable;\n\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {\n        this.currentScrollPosition = this.windowService.currentScrollPosition;\n    }\n}window\nThe window-service exposes the window property which is a link to the Window object.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    public window$: Observable;\n\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {\n        this.window = this.windowService.window;\n    }\n}document\nThe window-service also exposes the document property which is a link to the Document object.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    public document$: Observable;\n\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {\n        this.document = this.windowService.document;\n    }\n}Methods\nscrollTo\nA scrollTo method is provided to scroll to a position on the page. When there is no window, it will do nothing.\nThe offset is set to 0 by default so triggering the method without a value will scroll to the top of the page.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {}\n\n    public somethingHappened(): void {\n        this.windowService.scrollTo(500);\n    }\n}hasDocument\nThe hasDocument-method is provided to check if there is a document.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {}\n\n    public aCoolMethod(): void {\n        if (this.windowService.hasDocument()) {\n            // do something that depends on the document.\n        }\n    }\n}isBrowser\nThe isBrowser-method is provided to check if the current platform is a browser.\nIt uses the isPlatformBrowser method with the PLATFORM_ID injection-token internally.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {}\n\n    public aCoolMethod(): void {\n        if (this.windowService.isBrowser()) {\n            // do something that depends on the browser.\n        }\n    }\n}runInBrowser\nThe runInBrowser-method is provided to run a specific callback only when in the browser.\nThe callback has access to the window and the document elements provided in its parameters.\nExample :import { NgxWindowService } from '@ibenvandeveire/ngx-core';\n\nexport class YourComponent {\n    constructor(private windowService: NgxWindowService) {}\n\n    public aCoolMethod(): void {\n        this.windowService.runInBrowser(({ browserWindow, browserDocument }) => {\n            // Do something with the browser window or document\n        });\n
